## Try it out

#### Run in simulator

```bash
git clone git@github.com:just4fun/uestc-bbs-react-native.git
cd uestc-bbs-react-native
npm install
```
Then use Xcode to open this project and simply click **Run**.

#### Run on your iOS device

- Execute same commands as [Run in simulator](https://github.com/just4fun/uestc-bbs-react-native#run-in-simulator) except last step with Xcode, then follow this [official guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html)
  - **Tip**: JavaScript thread performance suffers greatly when running in dev mode (refer [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance.html)), so it's best to change `Build Configuration` from `Debug` to `Release` when using offline bundle (refer [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html#using-offline-bundle)).

## Run ESlint

```bash
npm run eslint
```
